# VJ Software Lab 🧪

**R&D playground by Daniel Fuentes - experiments, prototypes, and tech spikes.**  
_VJ = Vicente & Joaquín (my twin sons) — this lab is named after them._

> This space is for **learning in public**: trying ideas fast, documenting what works, and sharing useful building blocks.  
> Production-grade delivery happens at **Atelier Busco**. VJ Lab is the **experimental wing**.

## 🔺 Where this fits — The R&D triad

- **Daniel (Personal)** — notes, ideas, and foundational research.  
- **Atelier Busco (Studio)** — client-facing products, production quality, SLAs.  
- **VJ Software Lab (Lab)** — experiments, prototypes, OSS utilities, and technical proof-of-concepts.

---

## 🧰 What lives here

- **Prototypes & MVP spikes** (mobile/web/backends)  
- **Architecture trials** (serverless patterns, modular frontends, event-driven systems)  
- **AI/LLM experiments** (RAG, eval harnesses, prompt engineering, agents)  
- **Dev tooling** (CLIs, validators, code generators, CI/CD recipes)  
- **Data & dashboards** (ETL stubs, observability demos, cost monitors)  
- **Teaching assets** (sample apps, playgrounds, workshop material)

> If something proves valuable, it may **graduate** and move to a dedicated repo or into Atelier Busco projects.

## 🚦 Stability & versioning

- 🧪 **Lab** — unstable, breaking changes expected, minimal docs.  
- 🔬 **Incubating** — gaining traction, clearer API, basic docs & tests.  
- ✅ **Graduated** — stable and moved/linked from here (see the repo’s README).

**Use at your own risk. Not production software** unless explicitly marked *Graduated*.

## 🧩 How to use this lab

- Explore by folder or tags; each project has its own README.  
- Look for **ADR.md** / **NOTES.md** for context and decisions.  
- Issues and discussions are welcome if the repo is public.  
- Reuse freely where licenses allow (see each project’s `LICENSE`).

> Default license is **MIT**, unless a project specifies otherwise.

## 🛠️ Tech playground

**Frontend**: Angular, React, Tailwind, micro-interactions  
**Mobile**: Flutter (iOS/Android)  
**Backend**: Node.js (NestJS), FastAPI, REST/Webhooks  
**Cloud**: AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, RDS, CloudFront), Serverless Framework  
**Data & AI**: vector stores, RAG, orchestration, evaluation harnesses  
**Ops**: GitHub Actions, IaC, cost & reliability experiments

## 🧭 What this is not

- A portfolio site or sales page (that’s **Atelier Busco**).  
- A place for client artifacts, private data, or NDAs.  
- A promise of long-term maintenance for experimental code.
